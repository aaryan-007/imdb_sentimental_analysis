# Our Project Goal

Our aim in this project is to build a model that can predict whether a given movie review is positive or negative.

We’ll be using a dataset of IMDB movie reviews, where each review is labeled with its sentiment.

## What You’ll Learn
- Data handling and exploration with Python.
- Text preprocessing techniques like cleaning, tokenization, normalization, etc.
- Build Neural Network for Sentiment Analysis.
- Train A Neural Network.
- Model Evaluation.

## Data handling and exploration with Python

First, let's take a look at these blocks here:

```python
# Import important libraries:

# Pandas for managing data efficiently using dataframes.
import pandas as pd

# NumPy for powerful array operations, especially for numerical tasks.
import numpy as np

# Matplotlib for creating informative visualizations to gain insights from the data.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
